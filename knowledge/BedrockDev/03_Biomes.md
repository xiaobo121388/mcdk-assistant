# BIOMES DOCUMENTATION Version: 1.21.90.3


## Index


# Overview


Minecraft biomes can have different terrain characteristics. By writing custom biome data you could:1) Change the general shape of the terrain.2) Change the ratio of frequency of biome types.3) Change the blocks that make up the biome, both at the surface and down below.4) Change the distribution of decorative features like trees, grass, and flowers.5) Change the mobs that spawn.6) Change the climate.7) ...and more!


# JSON Format


All biomes should specify the version that they target via the "format_version" field. The remainder of the biome data is divided up into independent JSON sub-objects, or components. In general, a component defines what game behaviors a biome participates in, and the component fields define how it participates. There are basically two categories of components:1) Namespaced components, such as those with a 'name:' prefix, that map to specific behaviors in-game. They may have member fields that parameterize that behavior. Only names that have a valid mapping are supported.2) 'tags' which are defined under the "minecraft:tags" component. Tags consist of alphanumeric characters, along with '.' and '_'. A tag is attached to the biome so that either code or data may check for its existence.

Here is a sample biome schema with additional details and the full list of namespaced components.

# Adding Biomes


Biomes are read from JSON files in the biomes subfolders of behavior packs. Loading enforces one biome per file; and the file name and the actual biome name must match. Adding a file with a new name to the biome data location will make it available for the game to use, while existing biomes can be overridden using files that match their existing name. Note that if you add a new biome, you'll need to write component data that allows it to participate in world generation (as shown in the full schema below), or else it won't show up in your worlds!

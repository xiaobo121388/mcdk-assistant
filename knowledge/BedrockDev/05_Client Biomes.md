# CLIENT BIOMES DOCUMENTATION Version: 1.21.90.3


## Index


# Overview


Minecraft client_biome files define client-side settings for biomes in resource packs.This is the new preferred location for per-biome settings that used to be in biomes_client.json.(As of base game version 1.21.40, biomes_client.json is no longer loaded from built-in Vanilla resource packs. That file will still be loaded for other content regardless of version, and worlds using older base game versions will also still use it.)These files are not part of the 'Custom Biomes' experiment and do not cause biome definitions to exist on their own, but they can be used to customize client-side settings of custom biomes.


# JSON Format


Here is a sample client_biome file.

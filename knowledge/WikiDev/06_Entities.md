# Client Entity Documentation


Client entity definitions are contained within a Resource Pack. To start, create a new folder and name it "entity" inside the root of the Resource Pack. In the entity folder create a JSON file and give it a name.The JSON file needs a format version and minecraft:client_entity information.The minecraft:client_entity section contains the description for the entity. Under description there are a number of things that you can set about an entity. Generally, this file is defining what resources a mob requires and gives a friendly name to each, that the other definition files can use.

Example client entity definitions JSON for the pig


```json
"format_version": "1.8.0",

  "minecraft:client_entity": {

     "description": {

       "identifier": "minecraft:pig",

       "min_engine_version": "1.8.0",

       "materials": { "default": "pig" },

       "textures": {

         "default": "textures/entity/pig/pig",

         "saddled": "textures/entity/pig/pig_saddle"

       },

       "geometry": {

         "default": "geometry.pig.v1.8"

       },

       "animations": {

         "setup": "animation.pig.setup",

         "walk": "animation.quadruped.walk",

         "look_at_target": "animation.common.look_at_target",

         "baby_transform": "animation.pig.baby_transform"

       },

       "animation_controllers": [

         { "setup": "controller.animation.pig.setup" },

         { "move": "controller.animation.pig.move" },

         { "baby": "controller.animation.pig.baby" }

       ],

       "render_controllers": [ "controller.render.pig" ],

       "locators": {

         "lead": { "head": [ 0.0, 14.0, -6.0 ] }

       },

       "spawn_egg": {

         "texture": "spawn_egg",

         "texture_index": 2

       }

     }

   }
```


# Spawn Egg


This sets the color or texture used for the entity Spawn Egg. There are 2 ways to do this. The first is to use the hex value for the base color and the overlay color.


## Hex Value


Example Spawn Egg using hex value


```json
"spawn_egg": {

  "base_color": "#53443E",

  "overlay_color": "#2E6854"

}
```


## Texture


The other way is to specify a texture.Example Spawn Egg specifying a texture. The texture is located in the "items_texture" JSON in the textures folder of the Resource Pack. When there are more than one texture associated with a texture name you can use an index to pick the one that you want. If no index is specified than it is assumed to be 0 and the first texture in the list is used.

Example Spawn Egg specifying a texture


```json
"spawn_egg": {

  "texture": "spawn_egg",

  "texture_index": 2

}
```


# animation_controllers


Animation controllers decide which animations to play when. Each Controller contains a list of states that play one or more animations. Allows the player to assign names to reference the long names for animation controllers. Names are required and need to be unique from all other names in the animation controllers for that mob. Players can reference animation controllers from the vanilla Minecraft Resource Pack or create their own. Custom animation controllers should be in the animation_controllers folder at the root of the Resource Pack.


# animations


Allows the player to assign names to reference the long name for animations. These names are used by the animation controller JSON. Players can reference animations from the vanilla Minecraft Resource Pack or create their own. Custom animations should be in the animation folder at the root of the Resource Pack.


# enable_attachables


This determines if the entity can equip attachables when this is set to true. This allows the entity to render armor and weapons.


```json
"enable_attachables": true
```


# held_item_ignores_lighting


This determines if the item held by an entity should render fully lit up (if true), or depending on surrounding lighting.


```json
"held_item_ignores_lighting": true
```


# hide_armor


This determines if the armor attached to an entity should be hidden when set to true. This overrides the rendering settings specified by 'enable_attachables'


```json
"hide_armor": true
```


# identifier


The identifier is used to register the entity with the server. In the Client Entity Definitions JSON the identifier sets the appearance of the entity(materials, textures, geometry, etc.) The matching identifier in the Entity Behavior JSON in the Behavior Pack is what gives the entity its behaviors.


# locators


Locator offsets are specified in model space. An example of a locator is the "lead" locator used to specify where the lead will attach to graphically.


```json
"locators": {

  "lead": { "head": [ 0.0, 14.0, -6.0 ] }

}
```


# materials, textures, animations


Players can set the materials, texture and geometry used for the entity in this section. Players can set one or more materials, textures, and geometries that can be used by the mob. Players must set user defined names for them. These names are used in the Render Controllers JSON. Players can reference materials, textures, and geometry from the vanilla Minecraft Resource Pack or create their own.  Custom materials, textures, and geometry should be in the corresponding folder at the root of the Resource Pack.


# min_engine_version


When present, players can set the min version needed to allow the JSON to be parsed. The version in the definition is compared to the engine version for which the top resource pack was built.If a definition's min_engine_version is newer than that pack's engine version then the definition is not parsed.Multiple definition files may use the same identifier, in which case only one of those definitions will be loaded. The definition with the same or closest and not greater min_engine_version, as compared to the top resource pack's engine version, will be parsed; all other definitions with the same identifier will not be parsed.This can be useful for continuing to support an older version of an entity, when an older resource pack is used at the top of the resource pack stack, while also supporting a newer version of the entity in all other cases.


# particle


Allows the player to assign a key to reference the long name for particles. When these are present, the particle is created when the entity is spawned. Keys are required and need to be unique from all other keys in the animation controllers. Players can reference particles from the vanilla Minecraft Resource Pack or create their own. Custom particles should be in the particle folder at the root of the Resource Pack.


# render_controllers


Specifies the names of render controllers. This name needs to match the name of a corresponding JSON located in the Render Controllers folder. Players can reference Render Controllers from the vanilla Minecraft Resource Pack or create their own. Custom Render Controllers should be in the textures folder at the root of the Resource Pack.


# scripts


Scripts allow players to use Molang to compute calculations once and store that value. This value than can be used over and over again without the need to constantly recompute the calculations. Scripts currently support pre - animation and scale.More script types will be added later.-Pre-animation scripts are evaluated immediately before animations are processed.-Scale sets the scale of the mob's geometry.

Example pre-animation script for cod


```json
"scripts": {

  "pre_animation": [

    "variable.ZRot = !query.is_in_water ? Math.cos((query.time_stamp + global.frame_alpha) * 14.32) * 90 : 0.0;",

    "variable.AnimationAmountBlend = Math.lerp(variable.AnimationAmountPrev, variable.AnimationAmount, global.frame_alpha);"

  ]

},
```


Example scale script for the bat


```json
"scripts": {

  "scale": "0.35"

},
```


# Data-Driven Spawning


Data-Driven spawning allows you to adjust the spawn conditions of mobs, including new mobs added to the game to spawn naturally in biomes, add / remove a mob's spawn egg to the creative inventory and set the mob's spawn egg, and add / remove a to the / summon command


# Spawn Rules


## Biome Tags


Each biome in the game has one or more tags. These are used to determine what biomes mobs spawn in. Here is the list of Biome tags that can be used:


| Tag |
| --- |
| animal |
| beach |
| birch |
| cold |
| dark_oak |
| deep |
| desert |
| edge |
| extreme_hills |
| flower_forest |
| forest |
| frozen |
| hills |
| ice |
| ice_plains |
| jungle |
| lakes |
| lukewarm |
| mega |
| mesa |
| monster |
| mooshroom_island |
| mountain |
| mutated |
| nether |
| ocean |
| plains |
| plateau |
| river |
| roofed |
| savanna |
| shore |
| stone |
| swamp |
| taiga |
| the_end |
| warm |


## Conditions


Conditions contain different components that players can use to customize natural biome spawning.


### Components


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| minecraft:biome_filter | This component allows the players to specify which biomes the mob spawns in. Check below to see which Biome Tags exist, and what each biome is tagged as. |
| minecraft:brightness_filter | This component allows players to set the light level range that causes the mob to spawn. |
| minecraft:density_limit | This component allows players to determine the density cap limits for the specified mob type. |
| minecraft:difficulty_filter | This component allows players determine what mobs spawn when certain difficulty levels are set. |
| minecraft:herd | This component allows players to determine the herd size of animals. |
| minecraft:spawns_on_surface | This component allows the mob to spawn on the ground. Adding the component causes it to be true, removing it causes the mob to stop spawning on the surface. |
| minecraft:spawns_underwater | This component allows the mob to spawn underwater. Adding the component causes it to be true, removing it causes the mob to stop spawning underwater. |
| minecraft:weight | This component allows players to give a priority to how often that mob should spawn. Mobs with lower weight values have a higher chance to spawn than mobs with higher weight values. |

## Getting Started


New Spawn Rules are contained within a Behavior Pack. To begin, create a new folder named "spawn_rules" in the root of the Behavior Pack that you want to add the new biome spawn rules in. In the spawn_rules folder, create a JSON file and give it a name. The JSON file needs a format, description and conditions.Spawn rules contain description and conditionsAll Spawn Rules JSON need to have an ID (located under the description section). Similar to other identifiers, it follows the convention "namespace:name". The minecraft namespace is reserved for the vanilla Minecraft rules.When changing an existing mob use the ID that appears in the entity JSON for that entity. When creating your own mob, make sure the mobs have the same ID in all the entity's JSON files.Spawn Rules also needs to define the pool that is used for population control.Each pool has their own spawn limit, By setting an entity to a pool it will spawn as long as that pool hasn't reached the spawn limit.There are 3 pools that entities can be assigned to :-animal-water_animal-monster

# Filters


Filters allow data objects to specify test criteria which allows their use.For example, a model that includes a filter will only be used when the filter criteria is true.A typical filter consists of four parameters: name: the name of the test to apply. domain: the domain the test should be performed in. An armor slot, for example. This parameter is only used by a few tests. operator: the comparison to apply with the value, such as 'equal' or 'greater'. value: the value being compared with the test.A typical filter looks like the following: { "test" : "moon_intensity", "subject" : "self", "operator" : "greater", "value" : "0.5" } Which results in the calling entity (self) calculating the moon_intensity at its location and returning true if the result is greater than 0.5.Tests can be combined into groups using the collections 'all_of', 'any_of', or 'none_of'. All tests in an 'all_of' group must pass in order for the group to pass. One or more tests in an 'any_of' group must pass in order for the group to pass. All tests in a 'none_of' group must fail in order for the group to pass.
